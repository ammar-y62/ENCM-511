# PIC24F16KA101-Multimeter
This app project designed a multimeter that can measure current and resistance. To obtain these
values, the push buttons will be designed to change states, which PB1 for idle mode and a reset
will be used in case the code is stuck in idle mode, and PB2 and PB3 set to measure current and
resistance, respectively. The values obtained from PB2 and PB3 can be changed using the
potentiometer. All the information will be shown in the UART display such as the current
current, current resistance, and which push button is being pressed.
